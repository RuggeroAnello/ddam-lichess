# Distributed Data Analysis and Mining Project: Lichess Data

## Overview

Repository for my Distributed Data Analysis and Mining (DDAM) project. This project leverages PySpark to analyze a dataset from Lichess (July 2016), comprising 6.25 million records. The primary objective was to extract valuable insights from the data, perform extensive data cleaning and feature engineering, and apply machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of chess games.


You can access and download the dataset from the following link:

## Project Details

### Data
- **Dataset**: Lichess Data (6.25 million records - July 2016)
- **Scope**: Includes game details, player statistics, and other relevant features.

### Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure the dataset is accurate, complete, and free from inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful numerical features that contribute to model performance.
- **Data Analysis**: Derive insights from the data to understand patterns and trends.
- **Classification Task**: Predict game outcomes using machine learning models:
  - **Models Used**: Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
  - **Feature Configurations**: Two different sets of features were used to assess model performance.

## Getting Started

The code was developed and tested on Kaggle Notebooks. It is recommended to run the code from the Kaggle environment for optimal compatibility. You can access and run the notebook from the following link:
